# Climate Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to run a comparison between the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii to determine whether a surf and ice cream business will sustain year round.

## Resources
Jupyter Notebook, Python code, Pandas, SQLite
###### Precipitation Analysis
•Using pandas plotting with matplotlip to plot the data

•Using pandas to calcluate the summary statistics for precipitation data

•Using FLASK to gather the data

## Results
•The average temparature for June is 75º and December is 71º
•Maximum temparature in June was 85º and 83º for December
•Minimum temparature in June was 64º and December was 56º

## Summary
Based on the average temparature in June and December the weather stays very steady the ice cream shop and surf shop would do very well. The other mans would need to be evaluated to determine whether the surf shop and ice cream shop are worth it. Another query should be ran to look at precipitation, tropical storm patterns and surf swell.
